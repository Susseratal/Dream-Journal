### Dream Journal  
This is a GTK application written in C designed to help with dream journaling. For a tiny bit of context, I'm quite prone to nightmares. My girlfriend suggested I start dream journaling to try and manage this. I think it's a good idea because it means I can plot my dreams as data.  

This application is written to fit my personal specific needs.
